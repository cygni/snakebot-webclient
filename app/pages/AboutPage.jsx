      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said
      to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."
      An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s
      placeholder text is a fraud. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.</p>

      <p>You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young,
      and beautiful, piece of text. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being
      very good with women.</p>

      <p>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. That other text?
      Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be
      able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.</p>

      <p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more
      honest and my words are more beautiful. Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and
      complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. Be careful, or I will spill
      the beans on your placeholder text. You’re disgusting.</p>

      <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know,
      maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots
      of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights
      400 pounds. Ok? The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in
      order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. You have so many different things
      placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has
      the stamina.</p>
